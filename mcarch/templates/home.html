<p>Welcome to the the Minecraft Archive. Our goal is to make it easy to find old
Minecraft mods. To that end, we archive mods, and keep them publicly accessible
even after their creators no longer distribute them.</p>

<p>We provide downloads for mods which are no longer available for download from
their original creator. Otherwise, we just link to the official download page.</p>

{#<a class="btn" href="{{ url_for('mod_list') }}">Browse Mods</a>#}

<p>Talk to us in the <a href="https://discord.gg/fbhZB94">#mc-archive channel on discord</a>.
